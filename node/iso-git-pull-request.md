## Steps to create a pull request

The first step is to fork the repository on github.

Then we need to clone the repository and create a branch for the fix.
```
git clone https://github.com/dead-end/isomorphic-git.git

cd isomorphic-git/

git branch fix-1245

git checkout "fix-1245"
Switched to branch 'fix-1245'
```
